## ðŸ§° Using Cloudinary URLs with the Next.js Image Component

To allow Cloudinary URLs to load with the Image component, simply update your `next.config.js` file with the following configuration:

```
const nextConfig = {
  ...
  images: {
    domains: ['res.cloudinary.com']
  }
}
```

See the file in action at [next.config.js](next.config.js).

> Note: If using a custom domain with Cloudinary, be sure add the appropriate host in the domains array.
